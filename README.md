# Welcome to book_finder!

Hi there :wave:! </br>
This is my book finder implementation for Digital Product School's assessment challenge. I opted for a responsive Flutter application with a real-time database using Google Firestore. Fully functional prototypes including frontend & backend for mobile (Android) and web as seen below. The web version deployed on Google Firebase hosting can be found at this [link](https://dps-challenge-book-finder.web.app/).</br>
Enjoy :closed_book:!

1. To start the project, please open the project in your favorite IDE (Android Studio, IntelliJ, ...).
2. The first file you are looking for is the lib/main.dart file.
3. Execute the main.dart file. The app may either be deployed on a web or android device.

## Challenge
Full challenge at [DPS challenge webpage](https://dps-challenge-front.netlify.app/bookfinderapp)!

### Mission 1: Create a BookFinder App
- An application where users can search for books by entering a query. It should contain at least 2 pages:
    - Where you can add new book(title of the book, author, published date)
    - Where you can see the list of all books and user can enter a search query into an input field.
- You can have a frontend only solution, storing the contacts in your frontend application only or can have a separate backend for handling the storage.

### Mission 2: Publish your source code & Deploy
Publish your source code in a github repository. Weâ€™d like to see the steps how you arrived at the solution, so please make sure to commit every step you did and not just the final application in 1 or 2 commits. If you are not familiar with github, follow the instructions here.

The next step is to deploy the app. The app can be deployed to a cloud service. You can use (aws, google cloud, heroku or whatever you prefer, they usually all provide a freetier).

### Mission 3: Submit URL of my work
Submission via HTTP post request, details at challenge webpage.

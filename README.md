# Welcome to book_finder!

**WIP - do not publish before submission**

Hi there :wave:! This is my book finder implementation for the assessment challenge by Digital Product School. I chose a responsive Flutter-based application with a realtime database using Google Firestore with deployment to the Firebase cloud. Fully working prototypes including frontend & backend for Android, iOS and web as seen below. You may find the deployed web version at: TODO. Enjoy :closed_book:!

## Challenge
Full challenge at [DPS challenge webpage](https://dps-challenge-front.netlify.app/bookfinderapp)!

### Mission 1: Create a BookFinder App
- An application where users can search for books by entering a query. It should contain at least 2 pages:
    - Where you can add new book(title of the book, author, published date)
    - Where you can see the list of all books and user can enter a search query into an input field.
- You can have a frontend only solution, storing the contacts in your frontend application only or can have a separate backend for handling the storage.

### Mission 2: Publish your source code & Deploy
Publish your source code in a github repository. Weâ€™d like to see the steps how you arrived at the solution, so please make sure to commit every step you did and not just the final application in 1 or 2 commits. If you are not familiar with github, follow the instructions here.

The next step is to deploy the app. The app can be deployed to a cloud service. You can use (aws, google cloud, heroku or whatever you prefer, they usually all provide a freetier).

### Mission 3: Submit URL of my work
Submission via HTTP post request, details at challenge webpage.
